# Fujitsu_Sequioa_hackintosh_u729_u748_u758

this repository builds upon the excellent work already done by KrzysiuWojcik:

 https://github.com/KrzysiuWojcik/Fujitsu-Lifebook-U748-Hackintosh 
 
 for the Lifebook u729, u748 and u758 series of laptops.
 
 This is a tweaked/updated version that will boot Sequioa (up to 15.2) on your Fujitsu.
 
 What does not yet work:
 
 - certain BlueTooth mice
 - camera (not yet verified 100%)
 - SD-card reader (intermittent currently)
